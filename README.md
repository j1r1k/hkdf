# haskell hkdf
Implementation of HKDF (RFC 5869)

## Description

This is Haskell implementation of [RFC 5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869) (HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)).

Implementation is based on [cryptohash](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cryptohash).

## Installation

Run either `cabal install` or `stack install`. This is library, thus there is no executable available.

## Running tests

Tests can be run via `stack test`.

## Discalmer

Any feedback is very welcomed.
